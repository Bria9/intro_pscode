🔹 Collect user input: Prompt the user to choose a number between 1 and 10.

🔹 Store user input into a variable called "guess".

🔹 Use a loop to compare "guess" to "RandomNum".

🔹 While the number of guesses is less than 3 
    If "guess" is equal to "randomnum"
    print congratulations You’ve won 🎉 !”
    and end the game.
